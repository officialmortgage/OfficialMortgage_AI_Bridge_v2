Any dollar amount over the maximum LTV on the loan will be required to be paid by the borrower at closing. Can I build a new home on land that already has a single-family dwelling on the property? Land with an existing dwelling is ineligible for a One-Time Close New Construction transaction. To proceed with a One-Time Close New Construction transaction, the borrower would need to parcel off part of the land to allow for the new build. https://thesource.uwm.com/Search-Guidelines/UWM-Documents/Sales/One-Time-Close-New-Construction 23/26 2/20/24, 3:59 PM One-Time Close New Construction Can I demolish an existing single-family home and use One-Time Close New Construction to build a new home on the land? Yes. The existing homesâ€™ foundation can be used for the new build if it is within local code for the proposed new home. This is only eligible on conventional transactions. On VA loans, the existing foundation cannot be re-used, and the appraisal cannot show anything beyond the completion of the foundation. Can I include the demolition cost in the financing for the new home? The demolition cost can be added to the project budget by the builder. The ability to finance the cost will be contingent upon the appraisal and comparables in the area. Any dollar amount over the maximum LTV on the loan will be required funds at close by the borrower. Does the builder and the project need to be approved before submission to UWM? Although UWM does not require builder and project approval before submission, it is highly recommended. Both approvals are required before CTC of the loan. Having these approvals before submission can make the loan process much smoother and easier for the broker to set proper expectations with all parties involved in the transaction. On a purchase transaction when the borrower is bringing a down payment to closing, how will the funds be used when calculating the first interest-only payment? Any funds that the borrower brings to closing will be first used toward the initial, subsequent draws and closing costs. Once these funds are used, the remaining funds needed to construct the property will be applied to the outstanding loan balance. When will the builder expect to receive the initial draw? At loan closing, the appropriate funds for the initial draw will be collected with the title company. The title company will then wire the appropriate funds to Graniteâ€™s title company Premium Title Services, Inc. Granite will then disburse the applicable funds to the builder based on the information on Construction Loan Disbursement Feedback ( Granite Form E). Allow up to 10 business days for the funds to be disbursed by Granite to the builder. My builder is looking to give a credit toward the closing cost of the transaction. How will these funds be applied? UWM will deduct the builder credit from the initial draw paid to the builder. The builder credit must be included in the maximum product interested party contribution limits. What if the borrower has questions after the loan has closed? After the loan closes, UWM will reach out to the borrower with a welcome letter detailing the setup. Granite will also reach out to the builder once the loan has closed and Granite has the account set up in their system.The borrower can always reach out to UWM or Granite directly at servicingconstruction@UWM.com or UWMdraws@Graniteriskmanagment.com I am just starting a one-time close. Where can I find the Granite approval documents? One-Time Close New Construction Resource Page. For the Granite project approval , do I need to complete the Granite budget? https://thesource.uwm.com/Search-Guidelines/UWM-Documents/Sales/One-Time-Close-New-Construction 24/26 2/20/24, 3:59 PM One-Time Close New Construction It is best practice to have the builder complete the Granite budget. It is not required, and a standard builder budget can be submitted if it contains all the appropriate information. What happens if changes need to be made to the budget prior to loan closing?An updated budget must be provided to Granite along with an applicable construction contract addendum. You will then need to provide the updated Granite approval and construction contract to UWM to update the loan file. What if my borrower wants to be reimbursed for construction items that were pre-paid prior to closing? On a Conventional One-Time Close refinance loan, the borrower is limited to Fannie Mae limited cash-out refinance requirements. If the borrower already put a deposit down with the builder, they cannot reimburse themselves with the loan proceeds. Fannie Mae does not offer cash-out single-close construction transactions. On a VA Loan, how do the interest-only payments work if the builder is paying for them during the construction period? At closing, UWM will hold the interest-only funds that are included in the builder's budget on behalf of the builder in an escrow account. The interest-only payment will be paid when due. The borrower will receive a monthly statement showing the interest payment being made for the prior month. Can I set up an escrow holdback in case the build of the property is stalled due to seasonal weather changes or things like that? There are no escrow holdbacks allowed on Conventional or VA loans. The builders in the area should understand the changing weather and the possible challenges that come with it. When the builder submits their project to Granite for review, they factor in if the build time falls into a period where itâ€™s more difficult to do exterior building. Many brokers design their building plans to have the exterior done during the good weather months and finish the interior during the poor weather months. Any funds the builder thinks they will need to complete the project during any season should be included in the cost and submitted with their project plan to Granite for review. How does the builder receive the final draw? Feedback The final draw request may take 10 business days to 2 weeks to complete. Part of this process is to complete the loan modification period. An inspection must be completed prior to every draw to confirm the scheduled work is completed. Granite only pays draws on the work that has been completed based on what the inspector sees. Are owner builders (meaning the borrower is the builder) allowed? Owner builders are allowed on conventional loans only. The borrower/builder must get builder approval . The budget will have significant contingencies added to mitigate risk, meaning the borrower/builder will have to qualify at a higher payment, come in with a higher down payment and have higher equity. The borrower/builder must provide an LOX stating its their primary residence and there is no intention to sell the home or have spec home use. Can a borrower who already started building their own home transition into an OTC loan? Yes, this would be considered financing a pre-started loan. The one thing to keep in mind when the pre-start is done by an individual is the broker and borrower will still need to supply invoices, permits and supporting documents for the build already done. Granite will also need to send an inspector out to the property to make sure everything started is up to code before they approve the new project from the new builder. We will not be able to finance the individual completing their own build unless they are a licensed builder. https://thesource.uwm.com/Search-Guidelines/UWM-Documents/Sales/One-Time-Close-New-Construction 25/26 2/20/24, 3:59 PM One-Time Close New Construction Can borrowers get reimbursed for materials they purchased outside of the loan transaction for the new build? For example, if the borrower bought windows they really wanted and gave them to the builder to install during construction. If borrowers purchased anything for the home outside of closing, they cannot be reimbursed with cash in hand; however they can get equity credit for those purchases. If a borrower bought $10,000 worth of windows for their new home and gave those to the builder to install, we would count the $10,000 as money the borrower put down on the home, which would reduce their cash to close. They wouldn't be reimbursed for the $10,000 at closing. DATE UPDATED: 2/8/2024 PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL TO UWM - FOR USE BY UWM APPROVED PARTIES ONLY.
