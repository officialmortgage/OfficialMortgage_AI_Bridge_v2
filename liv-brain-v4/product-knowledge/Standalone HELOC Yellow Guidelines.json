There cannot be a mix of tri-merge reports and single bureau reports if there are multiple borrowers on the loan. Feedback If a tri-merge credit report is already provided for the borrower, a single-bureau report cannot be obtained and provided for the loan. Refer to the HELOC Product Matrix for minimum credit score requirements. TRI-MERGE CREDIT REPORT If tri-merge credit reports are provided for all borrowers, at least two credit scores are required per borrower. The lower of the two scores will be the qualifying FICO for the borrower. SINGLE BUREAU CREDIT REPORT When single bureau credit reports are provided for all borrowers, the qualifying FICO for the loan will come from the primary wage earner (i.e., the applicant with the greatest income on the loan application). Rental income and/or income from an ADU will not be considered when determining primary wages. If the income on the loan changes, the qualifying FICO will need to be re-evaluated and potentially updated. https://thesource.uwm.com/Search-Guidelines/UWM-Documents/Underwriting/Standalone-HELOC-Yellow-Guidelines#overview 4/9 2/8/24, 3:15 PM Standalone HELOC Yellow Guidelines It is not acceptable for a new single bureau report to be provided for any borrowers if the previous report is not expired.

DEROGATORY CREDIT Follow Fannie Mae for waiting period requirements. Extenuating circumstances are not permitted. Loan modifications or forbearance with missed payments are subject to a 4 year waiting period. The waiting period begins when the loan was removed from forbearance or when the loan modification began. If the forbearance was due to COVID-19, the waiting period can be waived if the following are documented: Feedback The forbearance documentation shows that it was directly related to the CARES Act (i.e., COVID-19); The loan entered a loss mitigation solution (e.g., reinstatement, payment plan, payment deferral, or loan modification); The loan is no longer in forbearance; AND The borrower has not missed any payments since coming out of forbearance INTEREST-ONLY FIRST MORTGAGE When the first mortgage is interest-only, the fully amortized payment must be used for qualification.
