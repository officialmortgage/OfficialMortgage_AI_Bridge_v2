11/16/25, 2:22 AM Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) Table of Contents â-¼ Adjustable-rate mortgages can give borrowers a lower rate and monthly payment than a fixed loan. ARMs can be a smart alternative â€" especially considering that fewer than 10% of borrowers stay in the same mortgage for over seven years. ARMs are also appealing to borrowers interested in short-term loans on investment properties. Feedback DEFINITIONS Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) or Variable-rate mortgage: A mortgage loan where the interest rate on the note adjusts based on a market index. Margin: Set by the lender, does not change after closing (located on rate sheet).

For Conventional ARMs: 2.75 (Margin) + 1 (Index) = 3.75 Fully indexed Rate For FHA and VA ARMs: 2.25 (Margin) + 4 (Index) = 6.25 Fully indexed Rate Caps: The max percentage the rate can increase or decrease at different adjustment points (located on rate sheet). Initial adjustment: The first adjustment after the fixed period expires. Subsequent adjustment: The adjustments that happen after the initial adjustment. Over the life of the loan: The most the rate can adjust over the entire term. Start Rate: Interest rate the loan was initially locked at. Floor: The lowest the rate can go; this is not lower than the margin.
